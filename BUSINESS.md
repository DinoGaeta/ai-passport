# Business Strategy & Adoption

## 🎯 Positioning
**Target:** Web3 Developers, Sovereign AI enthusiasts, DeAI (Decentralized AI) early adopters.
**Value Prop:** "Stop starting from scratch. Own your AI's memory forever."
**Differentiation:** Unlike centralized GPTs (silos) or crypto wallets (dumb storage), AI Passport is a **computational identity** that is portable, programmable, and user-owned.

## 💰 Monetization Models

### 1. Freemium "Gas-less" (Growth)
- **Free:** User creates passport. We subsidize cycles for basic usage (storage < 10MB).
- **Premium ($5/mo):** Unlimited storage, "Gold" verified badge, priority access to new Skill Modules.
- **Why:** Low barrier to entry is crucial for network effects.

### 2. Marketplace of Skills (Ecosystem)
- **Concept:** Developers build "Skills" (e.g., "Legal Advisor Logic", "Gaming Companion Mode").
- **Revenue:** Users buy Skills. Platform takes 10% fee.
- **Why:** Incentivizes devs to build ON TOP of AI Passport.

### 3. B2B Integration API (Scale)
- **Concept:** Games/Apps pay to write to user memories automatically (e.g., "Game X wants to log your victory").
- **Revenue:** Volume-based API fees (paid in cycles/tokens).
- **Why:** Sustainable revenue from high-volume apps.

## 🎬 Narrative Use Cases

### 🛡 The RPG Gamer
**Scenario:** Player defeats a boss in "CyberQuest" using diplomacy.
**AI Passport:** Logs `Trait: Diplomat` and `Event: Peace Treaty`.
**Payoff:** Player opens "SpaceTrader" (different game). The NPC says: "I see you're a diplomat. I'll offer you a trade route instead of a fight."

### ✍️ The Writer
**Scenario:** User tells their AI writing tool: "Never use the passive voice."
**AI Passport:** Updates `SystemConfig.negativeConstraints`.
**Payoff:** User switches to an Email app. The AI drafter automatically avoids passive voice without being told.

### 🏥 The Digital Patient
**Scenario:** User tracks mood logs privately.
**AI Passport:** Stores encrypted logs in `Memories`.
**Payoff:** User grants temporary read access to a "Therapy Bot" dApp for 1 hour. The bot analyzes trends and gives advice, then loses access. Data never leaves the user's control.

## 🧪 Market Validation Experiments
