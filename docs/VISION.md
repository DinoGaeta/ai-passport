# 🔮 Vision: The Sovereign AI Layer

## The Problem
We are entering the age of AI Agents. Soon, everyone will have a personal AI companion.
Currently, these agents are:
1.  **Siloed**: Your ChatGPT doesn't know what you did in Midjourney.
2.  **Platform-Owned**: OpenAI/Google owns your agent's memory, not you.
3.  **Amnesiac**: Start a new chat, and the context is gone.

## The Solution: AI Passport
AI Passport is a **protocol** for portable, user-owned AI identity.

### 1. Sovereignty
You own the canister that holds your agent's data. No one can delete it or censor it.

### 2. Portability
Connect your passport to a game, and the NPC knows your name and playstyle. Connect it to a writing tool, and it knows your tone.

### 3. Interoperability
A standard schema for `Profile`, `Memory`, and `Config` that any dApp can read (with permission).

## The Future
- **Q3 2025**: SDK for Game Developers.
- **Q4 2025**: Marketplace for "Agent Personalities".
- **2026**: The standard identity layer for the Metaverse.
