**Title:** I built a decentralized "Passport" for AI Agents on ICP. Here's the MVP.

**Body:**
"Hey everyone, I've been working on a protocol to solve the 'amnesia' problem of AI agents. Current AIs are siloed—they don't know who you are when you switch apps.

AI Passport fixes this by storing your AI's system prompt and memories in a user-owned canister.
- **Tech:** Motoko Backend + React Frontend + Internet Identity.
- **Status:** MVP is live locally.
- **Goal:** A standard for portable AI identity.
